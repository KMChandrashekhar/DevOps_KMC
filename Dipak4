The gap between a 8 LPA and 24 LPA DevOps engineer?

Knowing why things break — not just how to fix them.

Most engineers start their DevOps journey focusing on tools.
Docker, Jenkins, Kubernetes, Terraform — we all chase commands, pipelines, and YAML files.

But when the real-world production issue hits, it’s not about running kubectl get pods.
It’s about asking:
● Why did the node fail?
● What was the root cause behind the memory leak?
● How did the deployment design contribute to downtime?
● Could we have prevented it through better observability or automation?

That’s the difference between knowing tools and understanding systems.
