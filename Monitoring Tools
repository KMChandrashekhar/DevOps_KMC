What is Monitoring?
Monitoring is the continuous process of collecting, analyzing, and visualizing system
and application metrics to understand the performance, availability, and overall
health of your infrastructure.

What is Prometheus?
Prometheus is a free and open-source tool used to monitor computers, servers,
applications, and cloud systems. It helps you collect and store data about how your
system is working like CPU usage, memory, disk space, and more and shows you
that data in a way that's easy to understand.
Prometheus is like a smart assistant that keeps checking how your systems are
doing and tells you when something needs your attention.

What is Grafana ?
Grafana is a free and open-source tool used to create beautiful dashboards and
visualize monitoring data collected from tools like Prometheus. Instead of looking at
raw numbers, Grafana helps you see graphs, charts, and alerts which makes it
easier to understand what’s happening in your system.
Grafana is like a dashboard in a car it shows you everything about your system in
one place, in a way that's easy to see and understand.

Why Use Prometheus + Grafana?
When you use Prometheus and Grafana together, you get a powerful and easy way
to monitor your system.
• Prometheus collects data like CPU usage, memory, disk space, and more.
• Grafana shows that data using beautiful graphs and charts.
In short Prometheus watches your system. Grafana shows you what’s happening
clearly and beautifully. Together, they make system monitoring easy and smart.

How Prometheus works ?
1. Prometheus asks other tools (called exporters) for system data — like "Hey,
what's the CPU usage now?"
2. Exporters give the data (like CPU: 30%, Memory: 40%).
3. Prometheus stores this data with the time it was collected (this is called
"timeseries data").
4. You can see or analyze this data using its own web page or by connecting it to a
tool like Grafana for beautiful dashboards.

How Grafana works ?
1. Grafana connects to Prometheus (or other data sources)
2. It reads the monitoring data (like CPU usage, memory, etc.)
3. You can use Grafana to create dashboards and display that data in graphs
4. You can also set alerts, so Grafana notifies you if something is wrong.

What is Node Exporter?
Node Exporter is a small tool used with Prometheus to collect hardware and system
metrics from your Linux server.

It runs on each server (node) you want to monitor and provides important data like:
• CPU usage
• Memory usage
• Disk space
• Network traffic
• System uptime
Prometheus then pulls this data from Node Exporter and stores it for analysis or altering

How Node Exporter Works ?
You install Node Exporter on a Linux server. 1.
It starts running and exposes data at:
http://<server-ip>:9100/metrics
2. Prometheus accesses this URL to collect metrics regularly.
3. You can visualize the data in Grafana as graphs, gauges, and charts.

Install Prometheus on EC2 Instance
1. Lunch an Amazon Linux EC2 Instance

2. Execute the below commands to install the Prometheus
- copy these all lines and execute as one command
-
sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/prometheus.repo <<EOF
[prometheus] name=Prometheus
baseurl=https://packagecloud.io/prometheus-rpm/release/el/7/x86_64
repo_gpgcheck=1 enabled=1
gpgkey=https://packagecloud.io/prometheus-rpm/release/gpgkey

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lest/prometheus-rpm/master/RPM-
GPGKEY-prometheus-rpm gpgcheck=1 metadata_expire=300

EOF

Then:
- sudo yum update -y
- sudo yum -y install prometheus2 node_exporter
- rpm -qi prometheus2
- sudo systemctl start prometheus node_exporter
- sudo systemctl status prometheus.service node_exporter.service

3. add port 9090 for Prometheus and port 9100 for Node Exporter in security group

4. copy ec2 public IP and paste in browser with port no 9090 now you should see
Prometheus dashboard.
To see Node Exporter copy ec2 public IP and paste in browser with port no 9100
