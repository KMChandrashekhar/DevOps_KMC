What is Monitoring?
Monitoring is the continuous process of collecting, analyzing, and visualizing system
and application metrics to understand the performance, availability, and overall
health of your infrastructure.

What is Prometheus?
Prometheus is a free and open-source tool used to monitor computers, servers,
applications, and cloud systems. It helps you collect and store data about how your
system is working like CPU usage, memory, disk space, and more and shows you
that data in a way that's easy to understand.
Prometheus is like a smart assistant that keeps checking how your systems are
doing and tells you when something needs your attention.

What is Grafana ?
Grafana is a free and open-source tool used to create beautiful dashboards and
visualize monitoring data collected from tools like Prometheus. Instead of looking at
raw numbers, Grafana helps you see graphs, charts, and alerts which makes it
easier to understand whatâ€™s happening in your system.
Grafana is like a dashboard in a car it shows you everything about your system in
one place, in a way that's easy to see and understand.
