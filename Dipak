After 15+ DevOps interviews, I realized something - you don’t need to learn 100 tools to crack interviews. Just master 20 real fundamentals.

Everyone’s busy chasing the next shiny tool - but interviewers still test how deeply you understand the basics that actually keep systems running.

Here are the 20 areas you really need to master as a DevOps engineer:

𝐂𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐋𝐢𝐧𝐮𝐱 & 𝐍𝐞𝐭𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠
1. User management, permissions, and file system
2. Systemd, process monitoring, and log analysis
3. DNS, load balancing, subnetting, and firewalls
4. Troubleshooting network latency and packet loss

𝐂𝐥𝐨𝐮𝐝 & 𝐒𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲
5. AWS core services (EC2, S3, IAM, VPC)
6. Load balancer configurations and multi-region setups
7. Monitoring and alerting with Prometheus and Grafana

𝐂𝐈/𝐂𝐃 & 𝐀𝐮𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧
8. Jenkins pipelines and GitHub Actions workflows
9. Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
10. Configuration management (Ansible or similar)
11. Canary and Blue-Green deployments

𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐫𝐬 & 𝐎𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧
12. Dockerfile optimization and multi-stage builds
13. Kubernetes deployments, services, and autoscaling
14. Helm charts and secrets management
15. Rollback and recovery strategies

𝐒𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐲 & 𝐑𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐚𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲
16. CI/CD pipeline security and secret scanning
17. SSL/TLS, IAM policies, and RBAC
18. Backup and disaster recovery automation

𝐒𝐑𝐄 & 𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐥-𝐖𝐨𝐫𝐥𝐝 𝐒𝐜𝐞𝐧𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐨𝐬
19. Incident management and postmortem analysis
20. Cost optimization and performance tuning

Most engineers spend months learning fancy tools. The best ones spend that time mastering how to design, debug, and deliver under pressure.

Companies like Google, Netflix, and Amazon don’t care if you know every CLI flag - they care if you can keep systems up when things break.
