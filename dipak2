He missed a 28 LPA offer from PhonePe — not for lack of skill, but for lack of alignment.

One of my friends recently interviewed for a 𝐃𝐞𝐯𝐎𝐩𝐬 𝐄𝐧𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐫 role at PhonePe.
He had the right experience — AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, CI/CD — everything lined up.
But still, something didn’t click in the final round.

Here’s how his journey went:

𝐑𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝 𝟏 – 𝐃𝐞𝐯𝐎𝐩𝐬 𝐅𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐥𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐒𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠
The interview began with practical scenarios.
He was asked how Terraform manages state in multi-environment setups.
Then a Bash challenge — monitor a log file and alert on error spikes.
They explored AWS networking — VPC design, NAT Gateway use cases, and EKS node scaling.
He did great — crisp, confident, and clear.

𝐑𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝 𝟐 – 𝐒𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦 𝐃𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐑𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐚𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐒𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐞
The question that changed everything:
“Design a CI/CD pipeline for a payments platform with zero downtime deployments.”
He proposed GitHub Actions → ECR → EKS with blue-green deployment strategy.
Then came deeper questions —
How do you roll back failed deployments?
How do you ensure observability across microservices?
What’s your plan for schema versioning during releases?
He answered most well, but missed the mindset part — designing for failure and chaos readiness.

𝐑𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝 𝟑 – 𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐧𝐨-𝐌𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐚𝐥 + 𝐁𝐞𝐡𝐚𝐯𝐢𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐥
This round wasn’t about tools — it was about ownership.
They discussed a production outage he once handled.
He explained how he fixed it, but the manager asked,
“What did you change in your process after that?”
That’s where things slipped.
The conversation shifted from problem-solving to long-term thinking — how you prevent, not just react.

In the end, the feedback came clear:
“Technically strong, but didn’t align with how we think about reliability and ownership.”

He didn’t lose because he lacked knowledge.
He lost because he hadn’t learned to 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐤 𝐥𝐢𝐤𝐞 𝐚𝐧 𝐒𝐑𝐄 — 𝐭𝐨 𝐛𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝 𝐬𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫, 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐣𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐝𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐲.
