The difference between a 10 LPA and a 35 LPA DevOps Engineer?
How deeply they understand 𝐊𝐮𝐛𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐬 𝐢𝐧 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐥-𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐥𝐝 𝐬𝐜𝐞𝐧𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐨𝐬.

Anyone can deploy a pod.
But can you debug why it’s crashing at 2 AM when the production traffic spikes?
That’s what companies actually pay for.

Here are some 𝐊𝐮𝐛𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐬 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐞𝐰 𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 that separate good engineers from great ones:
1. Your pod is stuck in CrashLoopBackOff. How do you debug and fix it?
2. How do you perform zero-downtime deployments in Kubernetes?
3. Your service is not accessible externally - where do you start troubleshooting?
4. Explain how you’d handle a failed rollout during a deployment.
5. How would you optimize resource requests and limits in a production cluster?
6. How do you secure secrets in Kubernetes?
7. A node went down suddenly - what happens to the pods running on it?
8. How do you handle database credentials rotation in Kubernetes?
9. What’s your strategy for backup and restore in a cluster?
10. How do you implement auto-scaling when traffic fluctuates heavily?

These are the 𝐬𝐚𝐦𝐞 𝐬𝐜𝐞𝐧𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐨𝐬 that help engineers move from writing manifests to 𝐝𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬 - and that’s where the big offers come in.
