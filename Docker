DOCKER
“To standardized way to package the application with its dependencies and deploy 
it on any environment.”
• Docker is a tool used to create, deploy,and run applications using containers.
• It makes it easy to deploy and run applications in a repeatable and secure
• Docker allows applications to run on separate machines with the same 
operating system kernel.
• Docker allows developers to create applications that can be quickly and 
easily shipped to different machines with different configuration

Docker is popular due to / advantages of docker
• Low system requirements
• Quick application portability
• Local development environment
• Continous integration and deployment
• Code isolation
• Increased efficiency

The Reason could be due to application not working fine : / why docker
• Dependencies
• Libraries and versions
• Framework
• OS Level features
• Microservices

DOCKER LIFE CYCLE
“Docker goes through complete life cycle from creation to deletion state”
1. Create: 1st stage is a creation of docker image .It can build from pull image 
from docker registry or by writing ‘Dockerfile’
2. Run: Running of docker container.It contains ports,volumes,environmental 
variables
3. Manage:After running container ,It is managed by various commands like 
docker ps ,docker start,docker stop,docker restart,etc
4. Update: Docker containers are updated by configuration,dependencies and 
restarting 
5. Backup: Docker containers are backup by creating snapshots of filesystem 
& metadata by the tools are docker volume and docker images
6. Restore:Docker containers are restored by images or container filesystem & 
metadata.
7. Delete: Final stage is deletion of container by command ‘docker rm 
containername
